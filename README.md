# Cargobot by EPFL
Cargobot is a Game you can play but MAINLY an introduction to how programming works! 
You only need python to run it : clone the project and run the gui.py to get started.
There are multiple "exercises" : these are some automatic code to show how a program works step by step.
To change the exercise, simply go to gui.py and line 10, change VerticalSort and write one of the following arguments:
>**GoLeft**

>**EndlessLoop**

>**AllRight**

>**AllRightSelective**

>**MultiSort**

>**VerticalSort**

You can also see if you are efficient by playing the game with buttons. 

Please don't hesitate to submit ideas of optimization, it's my first python project ^^
