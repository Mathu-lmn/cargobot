# cargobot
Cargobot is a Game you can play but MAINLY an introduction to how program works! 
You only need python to run it Just clone the project and run the gui.py to get started.
There are multiple "exercises" : these are some automatic code to show how a program works To change the exercise, simply go to gui.py and line 10, change VerticalSort and write one of the following arguments:  
GoLeft
EndlessLoop
AllRight
AllRightSelective
MultiSort
and of course VerticalSort
You can also see if you are efficient by playing the game with buttons. 

Please don't hesitate to submit ideas of optimization, it's my first python project ^^
